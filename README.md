# learning-Rust

I follow the Rust official doc for learning : https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/index.html
(It also is available in 'doc pdf' alongside another great rust learning sheet)

I'm using IntelliJ IDEA 2022.3 as an IDE

The various modules :
  Modules rattached to main :
    - main.rs : run the doc.rs module + implement some basic functions
    - doc.rs : it contain some basic notes based on the official rust doc (see above)

  Independant bin modules
    - cli_discovery.rs : first cli following the rust official tutorial on clis -> https://rust-cli.github.io/book/index.html
    - cli.rs : first real project, implementing basic functions via a cli
