# learning-Rust

I'm currently learning Rust and these are my first programs with this language

I follow the Rust official doc for learning : https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/index.html
(It also is available in 'doc pdf' alongside another great rust learning sheet)

I'm using IntelliJ IDEA 2022.3 as an IDE
